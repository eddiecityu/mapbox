## Demo Examples

These are stand-alone versions of the "showcase" examples in the deck.gl
website, with smaller uncompressed data sets to make it easy to understand
how they work.

* [3d-heatmap](./examples/3d-heatmap/README.md)
* [trips](./examples/trips/README.md)

Remarks:
* Since these examples are set up so they can be run both stand-alone and
  also loaded by the website (demo), their code is organize slightly
  differently than a completely stand-alone applications typically are.
  If you want to base your application on one of these examples you may want
  to make some small code simplifications by comparing to non-demo examples.
